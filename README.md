# 100 Days CSS Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days CSS Challenge repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/), where I'll be honing my CSS skills by creating something new every day for the next 100 days.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days CSS Challenge is a creative project aimed at improving CSS skills by designing and coding something new every day for 100 days straight. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this challenge offers an opportunity to experiment, learn, and grow as a front-end developer.

## Structure

- Each day's work will be documented in its own folder within this repository.
- Inside each folder, you'll find the code files (`HTML`, `CSS`, and any necessary assets).
- Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even join me in the challenge!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the day you want to explore.
